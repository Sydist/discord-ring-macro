# Ever wanted to bully George?
Today is your lucky day, I made this Discord ring spam macro just for the purpose of cyber bullying George! 

~~Sorry, George!~~ no im not lol
## How to use:
Currently there is no GUI, (I might make one in the future though!) so you'll have to do some things first:

1. Install [Deno](https://deno.land/).
2. Add a file named `.env` with your discord token inside: `TOKEN=<your token here>`
3. Insert the DM/Group ID and the user/users you want to ring id into the variables in `index.ts`. 
4. Open up terminal, navigate to the folder and run `deno run -A index.ts`
5. Give my condolences to George's parents!
